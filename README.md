overflow-menu
=============

A jquery plugin for truncating long lines of tabs into an overflow menu. Tabs that would otherwise wrap on small viewports get tucked into an overflow menu at the end of the list.

For now it is assumed that the tabs have had the jQuery UI tabs plugin applied to them.

See [index.html](https://github.com/smabbott/overflow-menu/blob/master/index.html) for an example.
